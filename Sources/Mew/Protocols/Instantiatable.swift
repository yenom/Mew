/// The base protocol that all ViewControllers (and ViewModels) should conform to.

/// `Input` should be a "value type" such as `struct` or `enum`.
/// It is recommended to define `Input` for each `Instantiatable` class.
///
/// `Input` can be shared with `Injectable.Input`.
///
/// If you want to implement completion handlers, please use `Emittable` instead.

/// ## associatedtype Environtment
/// `Environment` is a dependency resolver.
